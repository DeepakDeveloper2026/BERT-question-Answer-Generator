## 📌 Overview  
This is a **BERT-powered Question Answering System** that extracts answers from a given context. The model is fine-tuned on the **SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)** to provide high-accuracy responses.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Extractive Question Answering** using BERT  
✅ **Pre-trained Models** from Hugging Face (`bert-base-uncased`, `distilbert`, `roberta`)  
✅ **Handles Complex Questions** from text passages  
✅ **Web App Interface** (Optional: Flask/Streamlit for UI)  
✅ **Fast & Efficient** Inference using Transformers  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:** Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch/TensorFlow, Flask/Streamlit  
- **Dataset:** [SQuAD v1.1](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/)
